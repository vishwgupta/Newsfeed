Steps to work with SQLite:

1) Download and install SQLite as per system & VS configuration from: 
http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki

For my version of Visual Studio, I used:
- Setups for 64-bit Windows (.NET Framework 4.5)
 	sqlite-netFx45-setup-bundle-x64-2012-1.0.96.0.exe 

Note: It doesn't work if the version is not correct.

2) Download and install SQLite DB Browser:
http://sqlitebrowser.org/ 
or

3) From the attached SQL File, IMPORT the database into the SQLite DB Browser. 

4) In Visual Studio, make sure the project properties are as follows:

In the Build page, set the Configuration to All Configurations.
Under General, set Platform target from Any CPU target to x64.

5) Under Project Reference, import System.Data.SQLite.dll from the installed SQL folder.
Path looks like : C:\Program Files\System.Data.SQLite\2012\bin


Important: 
- SQLite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Instead, Boolean values are stored as integers 0 (false) and 1 (true).

- SQLite also doesn't directly have date and time datatypes, they can stored as TEXT instead and retrieved as follows:
